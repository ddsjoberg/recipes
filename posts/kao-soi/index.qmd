## Ingredients

Soup

-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil

-   2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic

-   2 tablespoons Thai red curry paste

-   2 cans unsweetened coconut milk

-   4 cups chicken broth or water

-   1 teaspoon turmeric

-   1 teaspoon madras curry powder

-   2 tablespoons dark soy sauce or kecap manis

-   2 tablespoons brown sugar

-   1 tablespoon fish sauce

-   4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice

Garnish

-   frozen corn

-   1 lb angel hair pasta, cooked and drained

-   shredded cooked chicken (roasted chicken breast from Safeway or Costco)

-   chopped cilantro

-   finely chopped red onions

-   deep fried shallots (comes in jar at asian food markets)

-   chopped green onions

-   chopped salted peanuts

-   unsweetened or sweetened coconut, toasted

-   quartered limes

## Directions

1.  Heat the vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and then add the garlic.
2.  Toss well and add the red curry paste, mashing and stirring to soften it in the oil, about 1 minute.
3.  Add the coconut milk, chicken broth or water, turmeric, curry powder, soy sauce, sugar and salt and stir well. Bring to a gentle boil, adjust heat to maintain a lively simmer, and cook about 10 minutes.
4.  Stir in lime juice, remove from heat, strain through fine-mesh strainer and cover to keep curry warm while you prepare the noodles and garnishes. Straining the soup makes all the difference between an OK kao soi vs. a good one.

**TIP**: Tastes even better if made the night before you plan to serve it.
