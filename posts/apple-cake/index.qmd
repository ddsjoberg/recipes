We made this a few times in winter 2023, and it's easy and tasty! Adapted from [All Recipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/219711/cinnamon-apple-cake-aka-hanukkah-cake/).

## Ingredients

-   cooking spray

-   1 ½ cups white sugar

-   ½ cup butter

-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract

-   8 ounces cream cheese, softened

-   2 eggs

-   1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

-   1 ½ teaspoons baking powder

-   ¼ teaspoon salt

-   2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

-   ¼ cup white sugar

-   2 large baking apples, peeled and chopped

## Directions

1.  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
2.  Beat 1 1/2 cups of sugar with butter, vanilla extract, and cream cheese in a bowl until soft and creamy; beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl.
3.  In a separate small bowl, stir together cinnamon with 1/4 cup of sugar. Stir 2 tablespoons of cinnamon-sugar mixture into flour mixture; reserve the rest of cinnamon-sugar mixture.
4.  Stir flour mixture into butter mixture to make a smooth batter, and mix in apples. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the top of batter with reserved cinnamon-sugar mixture.
5.  Bake in the preheated oven until cake pulls away slightly from the edges of the pan, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool cake completely on a wire rack before removing the pan and slicing cake.

## Notes

I've found that the cake is ready around the 1 hour mark, and 1 hour 15 minutes is too long.
